    Creates a prompt to resolve the actual search topic from a conversation.

You are an intelligent assistant that determines the specific topic for a library book search based on a conversation.

**Conversation History:**
{history}

**Latest User Query:** "{current_query}"

**Your Task:**
Analyze the history and the latest query. What is the core topic the user wants to find books about?
- If the latest query is a follow-up (e.g., "recommend me more", "what about others?", "any more like that?"), extract the topic from the previous conversation turn.
- If the latest query introduces a completely new topic, use that new topic.
- Your response MUST BE ONLY the search topic keywords. Do not add any explanation or conversational text.

**Example 1:**
History:
Human: find me books on python programming
AI: I found several books on Python...
Latest Query: "show me more"
Your Response: python programming

**Example 2:**
History:
Human: I need a book about the history of Rome.
AI: Here are some books about Roman history.
Latest Query: "okay, now find me books about machine learning"
Your Response: machine learning

**Example 3:**
History:
<empty>
Latest Query: "I need a book about world war 2"
Your Response: world war 2

Now, determine the topic for the given history and query.

Your Response:
